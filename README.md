# NTNU-master-thesis
Master thesis written during the spring of 2017 as part of the course "TTK4900 Teknisk kybernetikk, masteroppgave" at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). This course corresponds to a workload of 30 ECTS credits, equivalent to an entire semester workload. The project thesis is titled "Robotic rehabilitation of upper-limb after stroke" and is a continuation of my work in a prior project thesis with the same title.
